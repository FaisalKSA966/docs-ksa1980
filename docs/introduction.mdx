## Welcome

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **Discord Ticket Management System**. This guide will help you understand, set up, and manage your private ticket system.

:::info What is the Ticket System?
A comprehensive solution for managing support tickets on Discord with a modern web dashboard. The system combines a powerful Discord bot with a **Next.js** web interface, providing real‑time synchronization and advanced features for teams of all sizes.
:::

## Key Features

- **Real‑time Synchronization:** Instant updates between the Discord bot and the web dashboard with automatic data synchronization.
- **Advanced Security:** Discord OAuth authentication, role‑based access control and comprehensive audit logging.
- **Robust Database:** Powered by MongoDB Atlas with automatic JSON fallback for reliability and data persistence.
- **Modern Web Dashboard:** Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for a responsive experience.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components working together seamlessly:

### Discord Bot
Built with Node.js 18+ and Discord.js v14, the bot handles all Discord interactions including slash commands, button interactions and ticket management. It features automatic ticket creation, support role management and comprehensive logging.

### Web Dashboard
A modern web application built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript. It provides a responsive dashboard for managing tickets, settings and team members. Authentication is handled via Discord OAuth and the interface supports both dark and light modes.

### Database
Data is stored in MongoDB Atlas for high availability and scalability. An automatic JSON fallback ensures that the system continues to operate even if the primary database is unavailable.
